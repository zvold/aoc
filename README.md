# Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles

## 2023

The code is written in Go, and (provided you have Go runtime installed) can be
run with:

```
go run github.com/zvold/aoc/2023/go/day01@latest
```

The above will run the code for day01 on a small, embedded, test input.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository doesn't include the "real" puzzle inputs, which are generated
> for each user individually.

To run the code on your own puzzle input, use the `--input` command-line flag:

```
go run github.com/zvold/aoc/2023/go/day01@latest --input=<input_file>
```

> [!NOTE]
> For some days, the code doesn't output a complete answer, because I solved it
> on a piece of paper (examples are day06, day24) or with some external tooling
> (example is day25) and didn't bother converting it to code.

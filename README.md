## 2023 — 2025

The code is written in Go, and (provided you have Go runtime installed) can be
run with (example for 2023):

```
# Run on a small, embedded, test input.
go run github.com/zvold/aoc/2023/go/day01@latest
```

To run the code on your own puzzle input, use the `--input` command-line flag:

```
go run github.com/zvold/aoc/2023/go/day01@latest --input=<input_file>
```
